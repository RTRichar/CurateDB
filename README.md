# CurateDB
### Software for curating reference sequence databases used in barcoding, metabarcoding and metagenetics
CurateDB uses HMMER (http://hmmer.org/) and VSEARCH (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch) to search through sequences available from broad origions (such as NCBI Nucleotide, NCBI Genome and/or BOLD), identify and extract the precise barcode marker region of interest, discard irrelevent sequences, and dereplicate the resulting reference data in a taxonimcaly-supervized fashion.
